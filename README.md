##Automatic Table and Date Search
- Create a basic HTML web page  
- Using the UFO dataset formed an array of JavaScript objects, wrote code that appends a table to web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting   
    -  column for date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comment
- Used a date form in HTML document and wrote JavaScript code that will listen for onchange events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.  
- Using multiple input tags and select dropdowns, wrote JavaScript code so user can set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:  
    - date/time  
    - city  
    - state  
    - country  
    - shape
